This is a simple web app that uses Google Forms and Leaflet to allow data collection using just a modern web browser.

##Instructions

1. [Dowload](https://github.com/aogdp/gpsform/archive/gh-pages.zip) the app.
2. Create a Google Form with Latitude (Short answer), Longitude (Short answer) and Description (Paragraph) fields/questions.
3. Connect you form resposnes to a spreadsheet.
4. [Publish](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/37579?hl=en) your response sheet to the web.
5. [Pre-fill](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/160000?hl=en) the form to get the appropriate variables for the app.
6. Upload the app to a webserver or just fork this repository on GitHub and create a gh-pages repository so it will be live on the web.
7. Start Collecting!
 
##Enhancements
Could be added but I wanted to keep this app as simple as possible.

1. Add styling using Awesome Markers, Maki Markers or other plugins.
2. Add search.
3. More basemaps.
5. Layer selector.
6. Figure out a way to collect pictures taken with the device, and push that url to the google sheet. This would take much more coding than is in the initial app. I suggest this be accomplished manually.
